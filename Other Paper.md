#### Fine-Tuning can Distort Pretrained Features and Underperform Out-of-Distribution



#### DIAGNOSING AND RECTIFYING VISION MODELS USING LANGUAGE, ICLR 2023

可能有用的结论

* cross-model transferability phenomenon of this joint space, use text proxy for image task

#### PromptStyler: Prompt-driven Style Generation for Source-free Domain Generalization

prompt domain generalization -> image domain generalization, without any images. 通过prompt  synthesize other style in vision-language space.

a totally new training paradigm, where we train a classifier using text features while running an inference with the classifier using image features.
